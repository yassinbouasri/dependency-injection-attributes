# Introduction

Hey friends! Welcome to a brand new course that's all about *Dependency Injection Attributes*. What *are* Dependency Injection Attributes? Well, here's a little history lesson:

A long time ago, in a Symfony version far, far away, *services* (which are objects that do work) had to be configured in separate YAML or XML files. The cool kids called it "wiring up a service". *In* these files, we'd create a service ID, reference our service class, and *then* reference any service IDs, parameters, or scalar values that were required. While this worked great, it *was* a bit cumbersome. Anytime we needed to add, delete, or modify a service's arguments, we'd have to jump into *another* configuration file and update *that* as well. *Surely* we could find a better way to do that, right? You bet!

In a *subsequent* version of Symfony, *still* long ago, they added something called "autowiring". This allowed us to just create a PHP service *object*, and *any* other services required would be injected *automatically*. We just
needed to type-hint the service class or interface. While this was a *huge* step forward, we *still* had to configure this in YAML or XML, even in only *slightly* more advanced scenarios (like scalar arguments from a parameter). It definitely *reduced* the amount of time spent in configuration files, but it didn't *eliminate* it.

*Then* PHP 8 came along and added native attributes, metadata that can be added to class properties, methods, method arguments, and *more*. This was the perfect feature to enable us to do *all* of the configuration right in our service classes. With Symfony 7.1 - the version we'll use in this course - there's a *plethora* of DI attributes to use, and we'll take a look at each of them. We'll see that editing a separate configuration file is only necessary in rare, super advanced scenarios. For the most part, the `services.yaml` file, which is included in every new Symfony app, is all we'll ever need, and it will hardly ever change. We'll showcase *all* of these attributes in a fun little app so you can see how they work.

So here's the scenario: We have a smart TV, but we've lost the remote. We searched *everywhere*, but it's nowhere to be found. I bet those pesky remote gnomes took it to sell on "Gnomeslist"...

We found a replacement remote online, but it's backordered and it'll take *forever* to get here. What do we do? Well, while we were looking for a solution on "RemoteOverflow.com", a user (who is definitely *not* a gnome) told us about an API that exists for our smart TV. As web developers, we can use that API to create our *own* remote we can access and use on any tablet connected to our home network. Thank goodness the gnomes didn't steal our tablet, right? Right..?

To code along with me, download the course code for this video, open it in your IDE of choice, and follow the setup steps in the `README.md` file. I've already done that. Now we can spin over to our terminal and run

```terminal
symfony serve -d
```

to run the server in the background. Hold "command" and click on the URL here to open our app in the browser, and... *there's* our remote!
It does all the usual remote things like changing the channel, powering the TV on and off, and increasing or decreasing the volume.
That's pretty much it for now. If we spin over 
to the code, it's an almost out-of-the-box Symfony 7.1 app.

We have a single controller - `RemoteController` - and single route - `home`.
This contoller handles rendering the UI and button clicks. When a button is clicked, we handle the different button logic (represented by a `dump()`), add the flash message, and redirect to the same route. If it's *not* handling a button click, it renders this `index.html.twig`. That's our remote template.

In our `templates/` directory, let's take a quick look at `base.html.twig`. This comes from a standard Symfony install. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS, but *I'm* doing something a little different than you may be used to. Instead of installing an asset management system like AssetMapper or Webpack Encore, I'm using the Tailwind CSS CDN to keep things simple. This injects a bit of JavaScript into your page that reads through all of the Tailwind classes you're using in your HTML. Then it builds a custom CSS
file and injects it, *styling* the HTML. As you might imagine, this is kind of slow and should never be used in production. For prototyping and *our* purposes, it's pretty easy to get going and works great.

Now, if we take a look at `index.html.twig`, this is our *actual* remote template. It's pretty standard, and you can see the Tailwind classes we're using. This is where we're rendering our flash message, if one exists, and here are the actual buttons. They're wrapped in a `<form>` where each `<button>` *submits* the form with the name of the button that was clicked. The only thing that's a little non-standard is this `<twig:ux:icon ...>` tag.
This is a combination of two third-party packages that are both part of the *Symfony UX Initiative*.

First, we're using [`symfony/ux-icons`](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-icons/current/index.html). This package enables you to add `.svg` files to this `assets/icons` directory. Now, you can embed these SVGs in Twig using the filename (minus the `.svg`) as the `name` attribute in this tag. You can also add *additional* attributes like we have here: `height`, `width`, `class`, etc. These will be added to the embedded `<svg>` element. This package does other awesome things too, so google ["Symfony UX Icons"](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-icons/current/index.html) to learn more about it!

The other part of this `<twig:ux:icons ...>` tag is the tag itself. This comes from the [`symfony/ux-twig-component`](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html) package. At its core, it's basically a more advanced Twig `{{ include() }}` tag, allowing you to pass HTML attributes like `class` to components. An *optional* feature it provides is this HTML syntax. If you're familiar with components in frontend frameworks like Vue.js, this is basically the *Twig* version. The UX Icon package hooks into Twig Components and gives us a handy `UX:Icon` component that we can render with `<twig:ux:icon...`. That can make our template easier to read. To learn *more* about Twig components and all of the cool things they can do, search for ["Symfony Twig Components"](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html) and check out the documentation!

Next: Let's start *refactoring* our app to use *dependency injection attributes*.
